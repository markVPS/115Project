# **Project: Bitwise Dice Duel AI**

## **Overview**

In this project, you will design an AI agent to play a custom two-player stochastic board game.
The emphasis is on **game tree search (Minimax and Expectiminimax)** and applying **evaluation functions** to guide the search.

Your grade will be based mainly on your **Expectiminimax implementation**, **evaluation function**, and **analysis of search behavior**, not on trivial mechanics such as drawing the board or coding bitwise operations.

## **Game Rules**

* **Board:** ~40-square linear track. Each player has 1 token, starting at square 0. The first player to reach the end wins.
* **Dice:** On each turn, roll 3 eight-sided dice (values 1–8).
* **Moves:** Choose two dice and apply one of:

  * **Bitwise AND (∧)**
  * **Bitwise OR (∨)**
  * **Bitwise XOR (⊕)**
    The result is the number of spaces to move your token.

### **Example**

Roll **(3, 6, 7)**:

* `3 ∧ 6 = 2` → move 2 spaces
* `3 ∨ 6 = 7` → move 7 spaces
* `3 ⊕ 6 = 5` → move 5 spaces

**Collision rule:**
If you land exactly on your opponent’s token, their token is sent back to the start.

## **Minimax and Expectiminimax**

You have already studied decision trees, where results at the leaves are propagated upward.
Game trees are similar, with two new ideas:

### **Minimax**

* Alternate turns between a **maximizing player** (you) and a **minimizing player** (your opponent).
* The leaf value is a score (e.g., win = +1, loss = –1, ongoing = heuristic).
* Each level of the tree chooses the max or min of its children, depending on whose turn it is.

### **Expectiminimax**

* Adds **chance nodes** for dice rolls.
* At chance nodes, compute the **average expected value** over all possible outcomes.
* This allows you to handle randomness in games like *Bitwise Dice Duel*.

## **Requirements**

* Implement **game state**, **move generation**, and **transitions**.
* Implement **Minimax** search for deterministic play.
* Extend to **Expectiminimax** with chance nodes for dice rolls.
* Design an **evaluation function** that considers:

  * Distance to the goal (farther = worse, closer = better)
  * Collision opportunities (reward bumping the opponent, penalize being bumped)
  * Win/loss states (assign very high/low values)
* Provide **instrumentation (logs, counters)** to show node counts at different depths.
* Book a **10-minute final check-in** with me:

  * Demonstrate your program.
  * Explain any line of code I ask about and justify its purpose.

---

## **Tips**

* **Start small:**

  * Build a basic interface to play manually.
  * Implement the `GameState` struct and move generation.
  * Write **Minimax** with a simple evaluation function.
  * Extend to **Expectiminimax** for dice rolls.
* Use **depth limits** to control branching.
* **Instrument your code:** count how many nodes are expanded.

### **Displaying the Board**

Use Unicode tokens:

```cpp
cout << "🁣"; // Empty Space
cout << "🁤"; // Computer Occupies
cout << "🁪"; // Player Occupies
cout << "🁫"; // Both Occupy
```

To clear the screen each turn:

```cpp
#ifdef _WIN32
system("cls");
#else
system("clear");
#endif
```

## **Stretch Goals (+5% each)**

1. **Alpha–Beta Pruning:**
   Add pruning to reduce the number of nodes explored. Show logs comparing node counts.
2. **Graphical Interface:**
   Replace text display with a simple graphics library (e.g., SFML or Raylib).
